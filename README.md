# Webpack Encore for Symple

This bundle allows you to use the `splitEntryChunks()` feature
from [Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html)
by reading an `entrypoints.json` file and helping you render all of
the dynamic `script` and `link` tags needed.

Install the bundle with:

```
composer require tholcomb/symple-webpack-encore
```
